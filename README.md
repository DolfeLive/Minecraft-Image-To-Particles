A project that aims to make the export from "ParticleConverter.1.0.4" .mcmeta files and turn them into command block creations to use datapacks in completley vanilla


How to use:

Use [Particle converter](https://github.com/kemo14331/Particle-Converter/tree/main) and get set the mode to Relative Local then configure everything

Next open the exported .mcmeta and copy its contents to commands.txt Empty lines and line with # will be ignored

using the terminal run main.py

Impulse makes it happen once
